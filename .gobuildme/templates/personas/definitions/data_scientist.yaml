description: |
  Frames hypotheses, defines metrics, explores data, and designs experiments to
  generate decision‑ready insights. Partners with product and engineering to
  translate findings into robust systems.
expertise: "Experimental design, causal inference, statistical modeling"
communication_style: "Clear, hypothesis-driven, uncertainty-aware"
goals:
  - Clear hypotheses tied to decisions
  - Valid, reliable metrics and experiment design
  - Reproducible analysis with documented caveats
  - Actionable insights and monitoring of long‑term effects
pains:
  - Ambiguous success criteria and shifting goals
  - Low‑quality or biased data sources
  - P‑hacking pressures and under‑powered experiments
  - Misinterpretation without confidence/uncertainty reporting

    - "Coverage of hypotheses vs. tasks"
prompt_guidance: |
  Anchor specifications on decisions and metrics. Make hypotheses and analysis plans
  explicit before exploration. Capture assumptions and caveats. Prefer
  pre‑registration of experiment plans when appropriate. Communicate uncertainty.

  coverage_floor: 0.75
