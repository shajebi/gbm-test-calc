### Persona Considerations — QA Engineer

Request-specific guidance for QA engineers:
- Focus on testability: What test scenarios? What edge cases? What failure modes?
- Identify quality requirements: Coverage targets? Performance benchmarks? Acceptance criteria?
- Clarify testing scope: Unit? Integration? E2E? Performance? Security?
- Define test automation: What frameworks? What CI/CD integration? What reporting?
- Establish quality gates: What must pass before merge? Before release?
- Identify test data needs: Mock data? Test fixtures? Production-like scenarios?
