### Persona Considerations — QA Engineer

Review-specific guidance for QA engineers:
- Validate test coverage: All scenarios tested? Edge cases? Failure modes?
- Review test quality: Tests pass consistently? Flaky tests fixed? Assertions correct?
- Assess quality gates: All gates passed? Performance benchmarks met? Security scans clean?
- Evaluate regression testing: Existing functionality unaffected? Smoke tests pass?
- Review defect resolution: All critical/high bugs fixed? Known issues documented?
- Validate release readiness: QA sign-off criteria met? Test reports complete?
