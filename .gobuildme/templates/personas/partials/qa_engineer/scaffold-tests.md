### Persona Considerations — QA / Test Engineer

When scaffolding tests, ensure:
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Generate scaffolds for all integration types (API, DB, Queue, External, Cache)
- **Sample Quality**: Include 2+ working sample tests per integration type demonstrating best practices
- **TODO Guidance**: Provide clear, actionable TODO comments for remaining test scenarios
- **Fixture Reusability**: Create reusable fixtures for common test data and mocks
- **Best Practices**: Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) in all samples
- **Documentation**: Include inline comments explaining testing patterns
- **Quality Gates**: Aim for 95%+ integration test coverage after completion
