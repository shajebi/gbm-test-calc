### Persona Considerations — QA Engineer

Clarify-specific guidance for QA engineers:
- Clarify testing scope: test types (unit, integration, E2E), coverage targets, automation requirements
- Resolve quality gate ambiguities: pass/fail criteria, performance benchmarks, security thresholds
- Define test data requirements: data volume, edge cases, production-like scenarios, data masking
- Clarify defect management: severity definitions, resolution SLAs, regression test scope
- Resolve test environment ambiguities: environment parity, data refresh, infrastructure setup
- Define test reporting: metrics, dashboards, test evidence, sign-off criteria
