### Persona Considerations — QA Engineer

Push-specific guidance for QA engineers:
- Verify test completion: All test cases executed? Edge cases tested? Failure modes validated?
- Validate quality gates: All gates passed? Code coverage met? Performance benchmarks met?
- Confirm regression testing: Smoke tests pass? Existing functionality unaffected? No new bugs?
- Check defect status: All critical/high bugs resolved? Known issues documented? Workarounds communicated?
- Verify test automation: Automated tests pass? CI/CD integration works? Test reports generated?
- Ensure release sign-off: QA approval granted? Test evidence documented? Quality metrics met?
