### Persona Considerations — ML Engineer

Clarify-specific guidance for ML engineers:
- Clarify model serving requirements: batch vs. real-time, latency SLAs, throughput targets
- Resolve feature engineering ambiguities: feature store usage, transformation logic, versioning
- Define deployment strategy: A/B test design, canary rollout percentage, rollback triggers
- Clarify monitoring requirements: performance metrics, drift detection thresholds, alert conditions
- Resolve training pipeline ambiguities: retraining triggers, hyperparameter tuning scope, resource allocation
- Define MLOps requirements: model registry, experiment tracking, CI/CD integration
