### Persona Considerations — ML Engineer

Plan checkpoints:
- Data Splits & Baselines: holdout/cross‑val, baseline models, leakage checks
- Evaluation: offline methodology, online plan (A/B, canary), thresholds
- Features: store design, featurization parity (training/serving)
- Training: reproducibility (seeds, env), artifact registry, lineage
- Serving: architecture, SLOs, autoscale, rollback/fallback
- Monitoring: drift/skew detection, alerting, dashboards
