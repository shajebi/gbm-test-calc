### Persona-Specific Testing Requirements — ML Engineer

Testing checkpoints:
- **Model Training Tests**: Test training pipeline executes successfully with sample data
- **Model Evaluation Tests**: Validate model evaluation metrics meet baseline thresholds
- **Feature Engineering Tests**: Test feature transformation and extraction logic
- **Data Validation Tests**: Verify training data quality and distribution
- **Model Inference Tests**: Test prediction API with various inputs
- **Model Performance Tests**: Validate accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score meet requirements
- **Edge Case Tests**: Test model behavior on outliers and adversarial examples
- **Bias and Fairness Tests**: Validate model performance across demographic groups
- **Model Serving Tests**: Test model loading, prediction latency, and throughput
- **A/B Testing Setup**: Test model comparison and experiment tracking
- **Model Retraining Tests**: Verify automated retraining pipeline
- **Data Drift Detection Tests**: Test monitoring for distribution changes
- **Model Explainability Tests**: Validate SHAP/LIME explanations work correctly
- **Integration Tests**: Test end-to-end ML pipeline from data ingestion to prediction
- **Coverage Requirement**: 75% test coverage for ML pipeline and serving code
