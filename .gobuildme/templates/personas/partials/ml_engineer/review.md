### Persona Considerations — ML Engineer

Review-specific guidance for ML engineers:
- Validate model serving: Correct inference logic? Latency requirements met? Error handling?
- Review feature engineering: Feature store integration? Transformation correctness?
- Assess monitoring: Model performance metrics? Drift detection? Alerting configured?
- Evaluate deployment: A/B test setup? Canary deployment? Rollback procedures?
- Review MLOps: CI/CD pipeline? Model registry? Experiment tracking?
- Validate production readiness: Resource requirements? Scalability? Observability?
