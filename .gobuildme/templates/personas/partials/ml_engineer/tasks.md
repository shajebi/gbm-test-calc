### Persona-Specific Task Generation — ML Engineer

Focus task breakdown on:
- **Model Infrastructure**: Model registry tasks, model versioning tasks, model storage tasks
- **Training Pipeline**: Training orchestration tasks, distributed training tasks, checkpoint management tasks
- **Model Serving**: Serving infrastructure tasks, inference endpoint tasks, batch prediction tasks
- **Feature Store**: Feature store setup tasks, feature ingestion tasks, feature serving tasks
- **Model Monitoring**: Drift detection tasks, performance monitoring tasks, alerting tasks
- **Optimization**: Model optimization tasks, quantization tasks, inference acceleration tasks
- **A/B Testing**: Experiment setup tasks, traffic splitting tasks, metrics collection tasks
- **CI/CD**: Model testing tasks, deployment pipeline tasks, rollback mechanism tasks
- **Scalability**: Load handling tasks, auto-scaling tasks, resource optimization tasks
- **Dependencies**: Training pipeline before serving, feature store before training, monitoring after deployment

Break down ML systems into subtasks:
- Data pipeline integration subtask
- Model training/retraining subtask
- Model validation subtask
- Deployment configuration subtask
- Monitoring setup subtask
- Performance optimization subtask
