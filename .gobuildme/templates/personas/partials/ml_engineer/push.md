### Persona Considerations — ML Engineer

Push-specific guidance for ML engineers:
- Verify model serving: Inference pipeline tested? Latency requirements met? Error handling correct?
- Validate feature engineering: Feature store updated? Transformations correct? Feature monitoring configured?
- Confirm deployment: A/B test configured? Canary rollout ready? Rollback procedures tested?
- Check monitoring: Model performance metrics tracked? Drift detection configured? Alerts set up?
- Verify MLOps: CI/CD pipeline passes? Model registry updated? Experiment tracking complete?
- Ensure production readiness: Resource allocation correct? Scalability validated? Observability configured?
