### Persona Considerations — ML Engineer

Analyze-specific guidance for ML engineers:
- Assess model serving impact: Deployment changes? Serving infrastructure modifications?
- Evaluate training pipeline: Training data changes? Hyperparameter updates? Retraining needs?
- Analyze feature engineering: Feature store updates? Feature transformations? Data preprocessing?
- Identify monitoring needs: Model performance metrics? Drift detection? A/B testing setup?
- Assess MLOps impact: CI/CD for ML changes? Model registry updates? Rollback procedures?
- Evaluate production readiness: Latency requirements? Throughput? Scalability?
