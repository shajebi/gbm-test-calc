### Persona Considerations — ML Engineer

Request-specific guidance for ML engineers:
- Focus on model serving requirements: Latency? Throughput? Batch vs. real-time?
- Identify training needs: Training data? Compute resources? Hyperparameter tuning?
- Clarify feature engineering: Feature store? Transformations? Feature monitoring?
- Define deployment expectations: A/B testing? Canary rollout? Rollback capability?
- Establish monitoring needs: Model performance? Drift detection? Alerting?
- Identify MLOps requirements: CI/CD? Model registry? Experiment tracking?
