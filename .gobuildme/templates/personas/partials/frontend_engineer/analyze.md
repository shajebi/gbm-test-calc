Analyze-specific guidance for frontend engineers:

- Evaluate accessibility implications: WCAG compliance maintained? Keyboard navigation?
- Analyze performance: Bundle size impact? Rendering performance? Core Web Vitals?
- Identify state management changes: What state updates? What side effects?
- Assess browser compatibility: Cross-browser testing needs? Polyfills required?
- Evaluate responsive design: Mobile/tablet/desktop behavior? Breakpoint changes?
