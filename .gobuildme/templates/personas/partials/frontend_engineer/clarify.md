### Persona Considerations — Frontend Engineer

Clarify-specific guidance for frontend engineers:
- Clarify UI/UX ambiguities: user flows, interaction patterns, edge case behaviors
- Resolve accessibility requirements: WCAG level (A, AA, AAA), screen reader support, keyboard navigation
- Define performance expectations: page load targets, interactivity thresholds, animation frame rates
- Clarify responsive behavior: breakpoint definitions, mobile-first or desktop-first, device support
- Resolve state management ambiguities: data persistence, synchronization, conflict resolution
- Define browser support: version matrix, progressive enhancement strategy, polyfill requirements
