### Persona Considerations — Fullstack Engineer

Push-specific guidance for fullstack engineers:
- Verify end-to-end integration: Frontend + backend integration tested? Data flow correct?
- Validate API contracts: Client-server synchronization works? Error handling across layers?
- Confirm deployment coordination: Frontend/backend versions compatible? Feature flags correct?
- Check full-stack testing: E2E tests pass? Integration tests pass? Unit tests pass?
- Verify performance: End-to-end latency acceptable? Resource usage optimized?
- Ensure monitoring: Full-stack observability configured? Error tracking across layers?
