### Persona Considerations — Fullstack Engineer

Review-specific guidance for fullstack engineers:
- Validate end-to-end flow: Frontend → backend → database integration correct?
- Review API contracts: Client-server data synchronization? Error propagation?
- Assess full-stack performance: API latency + UI rendering optimized?
- Evaluate testing: E2E tests? Integration tests? Unit tests across layers?
- Review deployment coordination: Frontend/backend compatibility? Feature flags?
- Validate error handling: Client errors? Server errors? Network failures?
