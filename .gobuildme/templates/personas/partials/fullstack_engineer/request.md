### Persona Considerations — Fullstack Engineer

Request-specific guidance for fullstack engineers:
- Focus on end-to-end requirements: User interaction → backend processing → data persistence
- Identify API contracts: What data exchange? What serialization? What validation?
- Clarify full-stack data flow: Client state → API calls → database operations
- Define integration points: Frontend-backend coordination? Real-time updates?
- Establish testing expectations: E2E scenarios? Integration tests? Component tests?
- Identify deployment needs: Frontend/backend coordination? Feature flags? Rollout strategy?
