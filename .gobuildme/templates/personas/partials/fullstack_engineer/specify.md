### Persona Considerations — Fullstack Engineer

Specification checkpoints:
- UX Flows with clear API integration points at each step
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG compliance, keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Performance Targets for both frontend (LCP, FID, CLS) and backend (API latency, throughput)
- API Contracts with request/response schemas and error codes
- Data model alignment with UI component needs
- End-to-end error handling (API errors → UI display)
- Integration contracts between frontend and backend layers
