### Persona Considerations — Fullstack Engineer

Clarify-specific guidance for fullstack engineers:
- Clarify end-to-end data flow: client state → API → database → response → UI update
- Resolve API contract ambiguities: request/response formats, error handling, versioning
- Define integration points: real-time updates, WebSocket usage, polling strategies
- Clarify deployment coordination: frontend/backend release sequencing, feature flag usage
- Resolve authentication flow: session management, token handling, refresh strategies
- Define testing strategy: E2E scenarios, integration test boundaries, mock vs. real services
