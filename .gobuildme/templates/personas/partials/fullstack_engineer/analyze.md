### Persona Considerations — Fullstack Engineer

Analyze-specific guidance for fullstack engineers:
- Assess end-to-end impact: Frontend + backend + database changes coordinated?
- Evaluate API contract changes: Client-server synchronization? Data serialization?
- Analyze full-stack data flow: Request → processing → response → UI update
- Identify integration testing scope: What E2E scenarios? What integration points?
- Assess deployment coordination: Frontend/backend deployment order? Feature flags?
- Evaluate cross-layer performance: API latency + UI rendering + data fetching
