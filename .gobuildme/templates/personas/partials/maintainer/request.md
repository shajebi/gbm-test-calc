### Persona Considerations — Maintainer

Request-specific guidance for maintainers:
- Focus on versioning implications: Breaking changes? Deprecations? Migration needs?
- Identify documentation requirements: What docs? What examples? What guides?
- Clarify backwards compatibility: What must remain stable? What can change?
- Define release scope: What version? What release timeline? What communication?
- Establish contribution impact: New patterns? Updated guidelines? Community impact?
- Identify maintenance implications: Technical debt? Future refactoring? Support burden?
