### Persona Considerations — Maintainer

Constitution-specific guidance for maintainers:
- Define versioning policy (semantic versioning, release cadence, LTS strategy)
- Establish changelog standards, release notes format, and communication procedures
- Document deprecation policies, migration guides, and backwards compatibility rules
- Define contribution guidelines, PR review standards, and merge criteria
- Specify documentation requirements and maintenance responsibilities
- Establish governance model for constitutional amendments and policy changes
