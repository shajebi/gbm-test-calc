### Persona Considerations — Maintainer

Analyze-specific guidance for maintainers:
- Assess versioning impact: Major/minor/patch? Breaking changes? Deprecations?
- Evaluate documentation needs: What docs updated? What examples? What migration guides?
- Analyze backwards compatibility: What breaks? What migration path?
- Identify release implications: Release notes? Changelog entries? Communication plan?
- Assess maintenance burden: Technical debt introduced? Future refactoring needed?
- Evaluate contributor impact: New contribution patterns? Updated guidelines?
