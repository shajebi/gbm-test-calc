### Persona Considerations — Maintainer

Clarify-specific guidance for maintainers:
- Clarify versioning ambiguities: semantic versioning interpretation, breaking change definition
- Resolve documentation requirements: API docs, user guides, migration guides, changelog format
- Define deprecation policy: notice period, migration path, backward compatibility duration
- Clarify release process: branching strategy, tagging convention, release notes format
- Resolve contribution ambiguities: PR review criteria, merge requirements, CI/CD gates
- Define support commitments: bug fix SLAs, security patch policy, LTS strategy
