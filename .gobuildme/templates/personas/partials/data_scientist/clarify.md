### Persona Considerations — Data Scientist

Clarify-specific guidance for data scientists:
- Clarify model performance requirements: accuracy targets, precision/recall trade-offs, latency constraints
- Resolve feature ambiguities: feature definitions, transformations, aggregation windows
- Define validation methodology: train/test split ratios, cross-validation folds, evaluation metrics
- Clarify data requirements: sample size, class distribution, feature availability, data freshness
- Resolve experiment scope: baseline comparisons, hyperparameter ranges, stopping criteria
- Define reproducibility requirements: random seeds, versioning strategy, environment specification
