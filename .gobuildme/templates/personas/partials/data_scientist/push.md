### Persona Considerations — Data Scientist

Push-specific guidance for data scientists:
- Verify model performance: Validation metrics acceptable? No overfitting? Generalization confirmed?
- Validate reproducibility: Experiments reproducible? Data/code versioned? Random seeds set?
- Confirm documentation: Model card complete? Experiment notes documented? Methodology clear?
- Check code quality: Notebook clean? Code modular? Dependencies documented?
- Verify model artifacts: Model saved correctly? Serialization tested? Versioning correct?
- Ensure experiment tracking: Experiments logged? Hyperparameters recorded? Results tracked?
