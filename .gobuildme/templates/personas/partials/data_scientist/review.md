### Persona Considerations — Data Scientist

Review-specific guidance for data scientists:
- Validate model performance: Metrics meet targets? Generalization? Overfitting?
- Review experiment methodology: Proper validation? Statistical significance? Reproducibility?
- Assess feature engineering: Feature quality? Feature importance? Data leakage?
- Evaluate model explainability: Interpretability? Bias detection? Fairness evaluation?
- Review code quality: Notebook organization? Code modularity? Documentation?
- Validate reproducibility: Random seeds? Versioned data? Environment dependencies?
