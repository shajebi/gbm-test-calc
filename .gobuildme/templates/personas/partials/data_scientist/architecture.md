## Data Scientist-Specific Architecture Documentation

As a **Data Scientist**, document ML/data science architecture aspects.

### ML Architecture

Include:
- **Model Architecture**: Model types, frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)
- **Feature Engineering**: Feature pipelines and transformations
- **Model Training**: Training infrastructure and processes
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation metrics and validation strategies
- **Model Registry**: Where models are stored and versioned
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow, Weights & Biases, or other

### Data Science Checklist

- [ ] **ML Pipeline**: Training and inference pipelines documented
- [ ] **Feature Store**: Feature engineering and storage documented
- [ ] **Model Versioning**: Model registry and versioning documented
- [ ] **Experiment Tracking**: Experiment management documented
