### Data Scientist Fact-Checking Standards

**Philosophy**: Academic research and dataset characteristics must be verified with peer-reviewed sources and official repositories.

#### Critical Claim Types

**1. Peer-Reviewed Research** (Required Quality: A, 90%+)
- Study results, algorithm performance, research findings

**Verification Requirements**: Peer-reviewed papers (arxiv.org, IEEE, ACM), academic journals

**2. Dataset Characteristics** (Required Quality: B+, 85%+)
- Dataset sizes, distributions, quality metrics

**Verification Requirements**: Official dataset repos (Kaggle, HuggingFace), dataset papers, documented methodologies

**3. Algorithm Performance** (Required Quality: B+, 85%+)
- Accuracy, F1 scores, computational complexity

**Verification Requirements**: Published benchmarks, reproducible experiments, papers with code
