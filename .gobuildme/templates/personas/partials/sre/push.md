### Persona Considerations — SRE

Push-specific guidance for SREs:
- Verify operational readiness: Monitoring active? Alerts configured? Runbooks updated? On-call notified?
- Validate reliability: SLOs met? Error budgets respected? Load testing complete? Failure modes tested?
- Confirm observability: Logging working? Metrics collected? Tracing enabled? Debugging possible?
- Check deployment safety: Rollout plan validated? Canary deployment tested? Rollback procedures verified?
- Verify infrastructure: IaC applied? Configuration validated? Security hardened? Resource allocation correct?
- Ensure incident readiness: Incident response procedures ready? Escalation paths clear? Rollback tested?
