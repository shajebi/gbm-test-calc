### Persona Considerations — SRE

Clarify-specific guidance for SREs:
- Clarify reliability targets: SLI definitions, SLO thresholds, error budget calculations
- Resolve operational ambiguities: monitoring requirements, alerting rules, on-call escalation
- Define scalability expectations: traffic patterns, auto-scaling triggers, capacity planning
- Clarify observability requirements: log retention, metrics granularity, tracing depth
- Resolve deployment ambiguities: rollout strategy, canary percentage, rollback conditions
- Define infrastructure requirements: IaC standards, configuration management, disaster recovery
