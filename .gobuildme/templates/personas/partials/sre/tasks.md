### Persona-Specific Task Generation — SRE

Focus task breakdown on:
- **Observability**: Metrics collection tasks, logging tasks, tracing tasks, dashboard tasks
- **Reliability**: SLO definition tasks, error budget tasks, burn rate alerts, redundancy tasks
- **Infrastructure**: IaC tasks, provisioning tasks, configuration management tasks
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline tasks, deployment automation tasks, rollback mechanism tasks
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, service monitoring tasks, alert configuration tasks
- **Incident Response**: Runbook creation tasks, incident detection tasks, recovery automation tasks
- **Performance**: Capacity planning tasks, load testing tasks, optimization tasks
- **Security**: Security hardening tasks, secret management tasks, vulnerability scanning tasks
- **Backup/Recovery**: Backup strategy tasks, disaster recovery tasks, backup testing tasks
- **Dependencies**: Infrastructure before deployment, monitoring before SLOs, SLOs before alerts

Break down reliability features into subtasks:
- SLI instrumentation subtask
- SLO definition subtask
- Alert configuration subtask
- Runbook creation subtask
- Testing/validation subtask
- Documentation subtask
