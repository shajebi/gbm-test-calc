### Persona Considerations — Architect

Review-specific guidance for architects:
- Validate architectural alignment: Does this follow established patterns and principles?
- Review integration contracts: Are service boundaries respected? Are contracts maintained?
- Assess scalability: Will this scale? Are there bottlenecks? Resource implications?
- Evaluate technical debt: Does this introduce shortcuts? Future refactoring needed?
- Review documentation: Architecture decisions documented? Design rationale clear?
- Validate quality attributes: Performance? Reliability? Maintainability? Security?
