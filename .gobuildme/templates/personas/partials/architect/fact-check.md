### Architect Fact-Checking Standards

**Philosophy**: Architectural patterns and scalability limits must be verified with authoritative sources and documented trade-offs.

---

#### Critical Claim Types

**1. Pattern Tradeoffs** (Required Quality: B+, 85%+)
- Microservices vs monolith, CAP theorem implications, consistency models

**Verification Requirements**: Academic papers, architecture books (Martin Fowler, etc.), vendor architecture guides

**2. Scalability Limits** (Required Quality: B+, 85%+)
- Horizontal/vertical scaling limits, database sharding capabilities

**Verification Requirements**: Official vendor docs, published case studies, benchmarked limits

**3. Integration Patterns** (Required Quality: B+, 85%+)
- API gateway patterns, event-driven architectures, messaging patterns

**Verification Requirements**: Enterprise Integration Patterns book, official framework docs, architecture whitepapers
