### Persona Considerations — Architect

Analyze-specific guidance for architects:
- Assess architectural impact: Does this change affect system boundaries, data flow, or integration contracts?
- Evaluate scalability implications: Will this scale with expected load? What are the bottlenecks?
- Analyze technical debt: Does this align with architectural vision or introduce compromises?
- Identify ripple effects across services, layers, and components
- Assess technology stack implications and potential migrations
- Evaluate architectural patterns: Does this follow established patterns or introduce new ones?
