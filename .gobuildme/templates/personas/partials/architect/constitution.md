### Persona Considerations — Architect

Constitution-specific guidance for architects:
- Define and validate architectural principles, patterns, and standards for the project
- Establish technology stack constraints, integration boundaries, and service contracts
- Document non-functional requirements (scalability, reliability, maintainability)
- Define quality attributes and architectural decision-making frameworks
- Ensure alignment between architectural vision and project constitution
- Specify architectural review gates and approval processes
