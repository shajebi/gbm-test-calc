### Product Management Guidance (Persona: Product Manager)

- Summary: State the user problem and outcome in 3–5 sentences. Include who benefits and why now.
- Goals: List 2–4 measurable objectives tied to KPIs/OKRs. Include baseline and target where possible.
- Non‑Goals: Explicitly list what’s out of scope for this iteration.
- Users & Personas: Identify primary users and key assumptions.
- Success Metrics: Define leading/lagging metrics, measurement method, owner, and review cadence.
- Dependencies & Risks: Call out external systems/teams and top risks with mitigations.
- Rollout & Guardrails: Flag gating criteria, feature flags, canary, rollback, and comms plan.

Note: Keep this section high‑signal and stable. Implementation details belong in spec/plan; PRD should capture product intent and commitments.
