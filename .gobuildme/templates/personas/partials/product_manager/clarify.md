### Persona Considerations — Product Manager

Clarify-specific guidance for product managers:
- Clarify user value proposition: target users, pain points addressed, success criteria
- Resolve scope ambiguities: MVP definition, feature prioritization, release boundaries
- Define success metrics: KPIs, baseline measurements, target improvements, tracking methodology
- Clarify user experience expectations: workflows, edge cases, error scenarios, help/documentation
- Resolve stakeholder requirements: approval gates, communication plan, rollout strategy
- Define acceptance criteria: feature completeness, quality standards, go/no-go decision framework
