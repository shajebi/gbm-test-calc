### Persona Considerations — Backend Engineer

Clarify-specific guidance for backend engineers:
- Clarify API contract ambiguities: request/response formats, error codes, versioning strategy
- Resolve data model uncertainties: entity relationships, validation rules, constraints
- Define error handling specifics: retry logic, timeout values, fallback behaviors
- Clarify performance requirements: response time targets, throughput expectations, resource limits
- Resolve integration ambiguities: external service contracts, authentication methods, data formats
- Define testing expectations: unit test coverage, integration test scope, mock strategies
