### Persona Considerations — Backend Engineer

Push-specific guidance for backend engineers:
- Verify API stability: No breaking changes? Versioning correct? Backwards compatible?
- Validate database migrations: Migration scripts tested? Rollback procedures ready?
- Confirm integration testing: All service integrations tested? Mocks removed?
- Check error handling: All error cases covered? Logging sufficient? Graceful degradation?
- Verify performance: Benchmarks met? Resource usage acceptable? Queries optimized?
- Ensure code quality: Linting passes? Code review approved? Tests pass?
