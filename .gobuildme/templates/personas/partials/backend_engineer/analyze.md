### Persona Considerations — Backend Engineer

Analyze-specific guidance for backend engineers:
- Assess API impact: Breaking changes? Versioning needs? Backwards compatibility?
- Evaluate database implications: Schema changes? Migration complexity? Performance impact?
- Analyze service dependencies: Which services are affected? What integrations need updates?
- Identify performance bottlenecks: Database queries? API latency? Resource utilization?
- Assess error handling: What failure modes exist? What recovery strategies are needed?
- Evaluate testing scope: What integration tests? What mocking is required?
