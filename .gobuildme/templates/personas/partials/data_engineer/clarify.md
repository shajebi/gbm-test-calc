### Persona Considerations — Data Engineer

Clarify-specific guidance for data engineers:
- Clarify data pipeline ambiguities: scheduling frequency, trigger conditions, backfill strategies
- Resolve data quality requirements: validation rules, completeness thresholds, anomaly detection
- Define schema ambiguities: data types, nullable fields, default values, partitioning strategy
- Clarify performance expectations: query latency targets, throughput requirements, resource limits
- Resolve data governance uncertainties: retention policies, access controls, compliance requirements
- Define monitoring requirements: quality metrics, alerting thresholds, lineage tracking
