### Persona Considerations — Data Engineer

Plan checkpoints:
- Architecture: ingestion, transform, storage layout/partitioning
- Orchestration: scheduling, retries, idempotency, backfill strategy
- Contracts & Schemas: evolution policy, validation points
- Data Quality: rules, thresholds, and CI/runtime enforcement
- Observability: lineage, metrics (freshness, nulls, volumes), logs
- Cost & Performance: pruning, partitioning, scaling assumptions
