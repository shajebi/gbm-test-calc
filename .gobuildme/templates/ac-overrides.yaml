# AC Overrides - Manual Review Configuration
# Purpose: Mark acceptance criteria that cannot be automated or require manual review
# Location: Copy to .gobuildme/test-results/ac-overrides.yaml in target project
#
# Use this file to document ACs that are:
# - Subjective (UX, "looks professional", "feels intuitive")
# - Non-functional without clear metrics
# - Requiring human judgment
# - Integration tests that need external systems
#
# These ACs will be excluded from automated traceability calculation

manual_review_required:
  # Example: UX-related AC that requires manual testing
  - ac_id: AC3
    reason: "Subjective UX requirement - requires manual usability testing"
    reviewer: "UX team"
    status: "manual_test_planned"

  # Example: Performance AC without specific threshold
  - ac_id: AC7
    reason: "Performance requirement is vague ('should be fast')"
    reviewer: "Performance team"
    status: "needs_clarification"

  # Example: External service integration
  # - ac_id: AC12
  #   reason: "Requires external payment gateway (not available in test env)"
  #   reviewer: "Integration team"
  #   status: "manual_verification"

# Valid status values:
#   - manual_test_planned: Manual test planned
#   - manual_test_complete: Manual test completed
#   - needs_clarification: AC needs more specific criteria
#   - deferred: Testing deferred to later phase
#   - external_dependency: Blocked by external system

# Note: Document all overrides clearly to maintain audit trail
